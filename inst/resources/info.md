## Overview

PMXcode is designed to generate pharmacometric model code for analysis
using the [NONMEM](https://www.iconplc.com/innovation/nonmem/) or
[mrgsolve](https://mrgsolve.org/) software platforms. PMXcode aims at
reducing the time needed to create a new model code and at promoting
good coding practices. PMXcode provides a wide library a template code
and, as such, implements an opinionated approach to coding and
documenting pharmacometric models.
