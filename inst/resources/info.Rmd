    <th style="font-weight:normal">PMXcode is designed to generate pharmacometric model code for analysis using the <a href="https://www.iconplc.com/innovation/nonmem/">NONMEM</a> or <a href="https://mrgsolve.org/">mrgsolve</a> software platforms. PMXcode aims at reducing the time needed to create a new model code and at promoting good coding practices. PMXcode provides a wide library of template code and, as such, implements an opinionated approach to coding and documenting pharmacometric models. Additionally, PMXcode supports the automated creation of code for univariate covariate testing.</br></br>Documentation and user's guides for each PMXcode module are provided in articles published at <a href="https://sbihorel.github.io/pmxcode/">https://sbihorel.github.io/pmxcode/</a></tr>
